            For Project 1: HTML Archive project we created a website called POP SURVEILLANCE. 
            POP SURVEILLANCE ARCHIVE is an archive that explores and displays numerous styles of fashion throughout New York and Japan 
            from the point of view of a surveillance camera. We gathered our photos from Google Maps Images and utilized the street view option. 
            While viewing photos from both New York and Japan, the two areas have similarities and differences. The New York fashion seems to have more outgoing and unique dress styles compared to Japan. There are casual and formal dress styles that express someone’s aesthetic and personality. Photos display some people attending work, some people are in the middle of work, some people are relaxing, and more events. The interesting realization of this archive is that we as a society are constantly being watched and observed. Whether it is for our safety or an invasion of our privacy, we never know when we are being watched yet we tend not to pay a big amount of attention to that issue. Both Naomi and I had to capture and collect photos of random individuals and dissect them and their styles. We almost take on the role of acting like the security cameras themselves. In our HTML code, we utilized the images responding to different pixel densities using the srcset attribute.
